Great work! Python cannot concatenate variables of different types!


Question: 2
Which of the following is NOT a program that will produce the following output?

hellohellohello


var = "hello" * 3
print(var)

var = "hello" + "hello" + "hello"
print(var)

In the following code, assume the user enters 3.

num_times = int(input("How many times?: "))
