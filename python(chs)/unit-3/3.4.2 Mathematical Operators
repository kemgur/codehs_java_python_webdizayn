Question: 1
What does the following Python program print?

x = 9 + 6 / 3 * 2 - 1
print(x)


9


+12


15


21

Great work! Python follows the order of operations so it divides 6/3 first (which equals 2), then multiplies 2*2 (which is 4), then adds 9 + 4 (which is 13) and then subtracts 1 (which is 12).


Question: 2
What does the following Python program print?

x = 12 % 4
print(x)


+0


1


3


4

Great work! The modulus operator gives the remainder when dividing two values. Because 4 divides 12 evenly, there is no remainder, so 12 % 4 gives a value of 0.
