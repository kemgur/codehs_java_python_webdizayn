"""
Assignment:
This example has two problems:

One of the variables is used before it is given a value.
Another of the variables isnâ€™t given a value at all!
Try to run this program, and see what happens. Then, see if you can fix it!

When you are done, the program should print the following:

10
20
20
30
80

Starter Code:
a = 10
print(a)

b = c
print(b)

c = 20
print(c)

d = a + b
print(d)

e = f + d
print(e)

Solution Code:
"""

a = 10
print(a)

c = 20
b = c
print(b)

print(c)

d = a + b
print(d)

f = 50
e = f + d
print(e)
