Assignment:
Write a program that lets you know if you can have a key or not, based on your role at the school.

First ask for the user’s role at the school. They can be a student, administrator, or a teacher. (And remember that capitalization is important! ‘Student’ is not the same as ‘student’.)

Example 1: Administrator or Teacher
For example, if this was the input:

Are you an administrator, teacher, or student?: teacher
This should be the output:

Administrators and teachers get keys!
Example 2: Student
And if this was the input:

Are you an administrator, teacher, or student?: student
This should be the output:

Students do not get keys!
(Note: You should also be able to handle a situation where the user enters a value other than administrator, teacher or student and tell them they must be one of the three choices!)

Example 3: Other
If they input anything else:

Are you an administrator, teacher, or student?: secretary
This should be the output:

You can only be an administrator, teacher, or student!

Starter Code:
No starter code.

Solution Code:
"""
role = input("Are you an administrator, teacher, or student? ")

# The role must be teacher, administrator, or  student. If it is none of
# these, the program will say so.
if role == "teacher" or role == "administrator":
    print("Administrators and teachers get keys!")
elif role == "student":
    print("Students do not get keys!")
else:
    print("You can only be an administrator, a teacher, or a student!")
