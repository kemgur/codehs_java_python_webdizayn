Question: 2
How would you round the number held in the variable pi to 3.14?

pi = 3.14159265

Question: 3
Why should you use round when you compare two numbers that have type float?



If you don’t, Python will only compare the whole part and discard the decimal part.


You don’t have to, but it’s good style. All of the comparisons will still work out the same way.


+Sometimes numbers can be rounded in unexpected ways based on how Python computes them. Therefore, it is best to use round in order to make sure both numbers are rounded the same way.


You should always use round when you compare two numbers, even if they are of type int.
