Assignment:
Write a program that makes the user guess a particular float. Now, recall that you should not compare floats to determine if they are exactly equal. In this program, the user wins if their guess is accurate to within 2 decimal places. You will have to use round in your comparison of their guess to your number.

If the user’s guess was too high, you should say so. Similarly, you should tell them if their guess was too low.

Here is an example run of your final program, assuming that your float is 3.3312:

Enter a guess: 5.0
Too high!
Enter a guess: 3.0
Too low!
Enter a guess: 4.0
Too high!
Enter a guess: 3.5
Too high!
Enter a guess: 3.25
Too low!
Enter a guess: 3.33
Correct!
Use the loop and a half structure for your program. You should have a while loop that looks something like this:

while True:
    ...

    if ...:
        break

    ...
Be careful - you may end up with an infinite loop in your program if you don’t break correctly! If you run a program with an infinite loop in it, the page might freeze and you might have to refresh it to continue.

Before running Check Code, make sure to set the value of the number to guess to 3.3312

Solution Code:
"""
my_float = 3.3312

# Your code here...
while True:
    guess = float(input("Enter a guess: "))
    if round(guess,2) > round(my_float,2):
        print("Too high!")
    elif round(guess,2) < round(my_float,2):
        print("Too low!")
    else:
        print("Correct!")
        break
