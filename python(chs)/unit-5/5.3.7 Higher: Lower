"""
Assignment:
Write a program that makes the user guess a particular number between 1 and 100. Save the number to be guessed in a variable called magic_number.

If the user guesses a number higher than the secret number, you should say Too high!. Similarly, you should say Too low! if they guess a number lower than the secret number. Once they guess the number, say Correct!

Here is an example run of your final program, assuming that your number is 3:

Enter a guess: 5
Too high!
Enter a guess: 2
Too low!
Enter a guess: 4
Too high!
Enter a guess: 3
Correct!
Use the loop and a half structure for your program. You should have a while loop that looks something like this:

while True:
    ...

    if ...:
        break

    ...
Be careful - you may end up with an infinite loop in your program if you donâ€™t break correctly! If you run a program with an infinite loop in it, the page might freeze and you might have to refresh it to continue.

Solution Code:
"""
magic_number = 3

# Your code here...
while True:
    guess = int(input("Guess my number:"))
    if guess == magic_number:
        print("Correct!")
        break
    elif guess >  magic_number:
        print("Too high!")
    else:
        print("Too low")
    
print("Great job guessing my number")
