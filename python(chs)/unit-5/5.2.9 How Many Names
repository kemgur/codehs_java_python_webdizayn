"""
Assignment:
Some people have just a first name and a last name. Some people also have a middle name. Some people have five middle names.

Write a program that asks the user how many names they have. (If they have a first name, two middle names, and a last name, for example, they would type 4.) Then, using a for loop, ask the user for each of their names. Finally, print their full name.

Hints:

The structure of this program will be very similar to that of “Running Total, Part 2”. Instead of keeping a running total of integers, you are keeping a running total of strings!
You can make a string variable that contains a string with zero characters like this:
my_string = ""
This is called the empty string.

Starter Code:
No starter code.

Solution Code:
"""
full_name=""
num_of_name = int(input("How many name do you have: "))

for i in range(num_of_name):
    name = input("Enter a name")
    full_name += name + " " 
    
print(full_name)
