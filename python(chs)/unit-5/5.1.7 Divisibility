Assignment:
We want to ask a user for two numbers and then divide them. The issue is that we cannot divide a number by 0.

The code has been started for you. Youâ€™ll now need to add in a while loop that forces a user to continue entering a denominator value until their input is not zero.

Right now, the program looks like this:

numerator = int(input("Enter a numerator: "))
denominator = int(input("Enter denominator: "))

if int(numerator / denominator) * denominator == numerator:
    print("Divides evenly!")
else:
    print("Doesn't divide evenly.")

Starter Code:
numerator = int(input("Enter a numerator: "))
denominator = int(input("Enter denominator: "))

# Use a while loop here to repeatedly ask the user for
# a denominator for as long as the denominator is 0
# (or, put another way, until the denominator is not
# equal to 0).



if int(numerator / denominator) * denominator == numerator:
    print("Divides evenly!")
else:
    print("Doesn't divide evenly.")

Solution Code:
"""
numerator = int(input("Enter a numerator: "))
denominator = int(input("Enter denominator: "))

while denominator == 0:
    print("Denominator cannot be zero!")
    denominator = int(input("Enter denominator: "))

if int(numerator / denominator) * denominator == numerator:
    print("Divides evenly!")
else:
    print("Doesn't divide evenly.")
