Assignment:
Write a program that will print out all combinations that can be made when 2 dice are rolled.

Your output should look like this:

1,1
1,2
1,3
1,4
1,5
1,6
2,1
2,2
2,3
2,4
And should continue until all values up to 6,6 are printed.

Because you know exactly how many times each loop should iterate, you should use nested for loops to complete this program.

No starter code.

Solution Code:
"""
# Numbers 1-6 for die 1
for i in range(1,7):
    # Numbers 1-6 for die 2
    for j in range(1,7):
        print(str(i) + "," + str(j))
