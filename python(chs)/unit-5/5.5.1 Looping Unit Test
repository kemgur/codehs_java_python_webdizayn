Question: 6
What does this program print?

temperature = 65

while temperature < 80:
    print("It's still a nice day")

Which of the following while loops would continue to loop as long as num has values between the range of 3-12, exclusive?



while num > 12 and num < 3:
    # do something with num

while num < 12 or num < 3:

while num < 12 and num > 3:
    # do something with num
Question: 8

+
secret_num = 10
while secret_num == 10:
    print(secret_num)

while secret_num > 0:
    secret_num = secret_num - 1


secret_num = 10
while secret_num != 10:
    print(secret_num)
Question: 9
When would a while loop be a better control structure to use than a for loop?



When you need to repeat multiple commands


When you need to repeat something 5 times

+
When you don’t know how many times something will need to repeat


When the user is inputting how many times to repeat something

Question: 14
What is the benefit of using the break command as in the program below?

magic_number = 10

while True:
    guess = int(input("Guess my number: "))
    if guess == magic_number:
        print("You got it!")
        break
    print("Try again!")


The user can enter as many answers as they want

+
The program will break out of the loop as soon as the user enters the magic_number


The loop will prompt the user to enter a number no matter what input they give


The loop will give the magic_number after a certain number of tries

Question: 15
