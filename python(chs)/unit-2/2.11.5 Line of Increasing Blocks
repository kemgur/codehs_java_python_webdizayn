"""
Assignment:
Write a program that will draw a line of 5 blocks that increase in size.
Follow these guidelines:

-The first block should have sides of length 10
-Each consecutive block should have its side length increase by 10
-There should be a space between each block that is as long as the block’s length before it (ie: if a block with sides of length 10 was drawn, the space should be 10 pixels wide)
-Tracy should start at position (-150,0)
Your program should also be broken down into functions!

Hints:
-Pay close attention to when you should increase your length variable.
-Don’t forget that you can use mathematical operators to alter the value of your variables!
