"""
Assignment:
Write a program that draws a pyramid of circles based on user input.
Ask the user how many circles they want on the bottom of the pyramid and then draw a pyramid of circles, subtracting one circle from each row.

Follow these guidelines:

-Create a variable called row_value to keep track of rows of circles
-Use a variable called radius to set the radius value to 25 at the start of your code. This will make it easier to manipulate in the future.

Hint: The Block Pyramid example program may be a good place to start!

Starter Code:
No starter code.
