Assignment:
Let’s make our bubble wrap more believable!
You’ve been given a starter code that will fill the canvas with light blue bubbles. It’s now your turn to add a highlight to the top right corner of each bubble.

To do this:

-Don’t alter Tracy’s first step of filling the canvas with circles. Instead, add another function that will be used after all circles are drawn.
-Write a function called make_highlight that will draw a white quarter-circle with a radius of 10
-Make sure you include a way to be sure the highlight is being drawn in the correct location

Hint: You should be able to reuse the move_up_a_row function that has already been defined.

Starter Code:
No starter code.
