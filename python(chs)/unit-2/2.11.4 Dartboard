"""
Assignment:
Write a program that draws a dartboard.
Make sure your dartboard:

-Consists of 4 concentric circles
-Has the center circle placed in the middle of the canvas with a radius of 25
-Has three circles surrounding the middle, that each increase in radius by 25 pixels

Be sure to also:

-Use a variable called radius to control the radius of the circles
-Use functions in your program

Hints:
-Determine how to draw one circle that is centered on the canvas and then add the other circles using the same function.
-The circle radii are getting 25 pixels larger each time, so find a way to move Tracy to the correct position before drawing each circle so they are centered!

Starter Code:
No starter code.

This code will draw 4 circles, with radaii that increase by 25 on
each iteration.
