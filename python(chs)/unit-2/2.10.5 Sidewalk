Assignment:
Have Tracy draw a sidewalk around the perimeter of the canvas.
The sidewalk should consist of:

-8 squares along each side of the canvas

Hints:
-Use Top Down Design to break this problem down into smaller problems before writing any code
-Determine how long each squareâ€™s side should be to fit 8 from edge to edge. Remember, the entire width of the canvas is 400 pixels!
-This entire problem can be solved with 16 lines of code, so determine which parts of your code can be repeated and write functions and loops to accomplish this!

Starter Code:
No starter code.
