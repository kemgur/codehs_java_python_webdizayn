Assignment:
Write a program that has Tracy draw a snowman.
Make sure your snowman:

-Is made of three gray circles
-Is sized based off user input. You should ask the user for the radius of the bottom of the snowmanâ€™s body. The middle circle should have a radius that is half the bottom and the top should have a radius that is half the middle.

Example:
-The bottom has a radius of 100
-The middle has a radius of 50
-The top has a radius of 25

Hints:
-It would be helpful to draw out a few scenarios based off different user input and determine a correlation before coding.
-Determine where Tracy needs to move in order to get on top of a circle to draw the next one!
-Be sure to use a function to draw each part of the snowman!
