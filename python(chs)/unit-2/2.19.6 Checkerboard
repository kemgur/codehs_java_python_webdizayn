"""
Assignment:
Write a program that will draw a red and black checkerboard on the canvas.
Squares should have side lengths of 40 pixels. They should alternate between black and red and each row should start with a different color.

Hints:
- You should use a variable called color_value to control the color of each square.
- The Bubble Wrap program might be a good place to start. You can find it here!

Starter Code:
