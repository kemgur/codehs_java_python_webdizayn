Assignment:
Write a program that will have Tracy draw a dashed line across the x-axis.
Make sure:

-Tracy starts at the left side of the canvas
-Lines are 50 pixels long
-Space between lines is 50 pixels

Hint: The entire canvas width is 400 pixels so to figure out how many times Tracy will need to repeat these commands, divide the width by how far Tracy has moved to draw the first dash and space!

Starter Code:
No starter code.
