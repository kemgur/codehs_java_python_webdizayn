Assignment:
Write a program that asks the user for a rating from 1-10.
Follow these guidelines:

-If the user rates between a 1 and 4, draw a red X in the middle of the canvas.
-If they rate between 5 and 7, draw a yellow horizontal line in the middle of the canvas.
-If they rate an 8 or above, draw a green checkmark in the middle of the canvas.
-Use the variable rating to save the user input value.

Hint: Write functions to draw each mark type and then use these functions in an if-elif-else statement.

Starter Code:
No starter code.
