"""
Assignment:
Write a program that will draw 7 shapes.
Your shapes should:

-Start with 0 points
-Each increase the number of points by 1 (ie: line- 2 points, triangle- 3 points, square- 4 points, etc.)
-Start with a radius of 20 and increase in radius by 20 pixels each time
-All be drawn from the same starting position
-Initialize Tracyâ€™s starting position using: setposition(0, -150)

Hint: It is difficult to use the value of i to control both the radius of the shape and the number of points so you may use a variable called radius to control this.

Starter Code:
No starter code.

Solution Code:
"""


radius = 20

penup()
setposition(0,-150)
pendown()

for i in range(7):
    circle(radius, 360, i)
    radius = radius + 20
