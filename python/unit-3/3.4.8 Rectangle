"""
Assignment:
Make variables to represent the length and width of a rectangle, called length and width, respectively. You should set length to 10 and width to 5.

Then, write some mathematical expressions to compute the area and perimeter of the rectangle and save these values inside variables named area and perimeter.

Use print statements to display the area and perimeter of the rectangle.

Your output should print the area on the first line and the perimeter on the second, like this:

50
30
Rectangle Area Formula:
Area = L * W

Rectangle Perimeter Formula:
Perimeter = 2 * (L + W)

L is the length of the rectangle and W is the width of the rectangle

Solution Code:
"""
length = 10
width = 5

area = length * width
print(area)
perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
print(perimeter)
