"""
Assignment:
Write a program that asks the user for the following things:

The names of three ingredients for a salad recipe.
The number of ounces of each ingredient required for one serving (these should just be floats, like 2.5).
The number of servings desired (this should be an integer). You should only ask for the number of servings once.
The program should then output the total number of ounces of each ingredient required to make the desired number of servings.

An example run of your program might look like this:

Enter ingredient 1: mixed greens
Ounces of mixed greens: 1.7
Enter ingredient 2: blueberries
Ounces of blueberries: 2.0
Enter ingredient 3: walnuts
Ounces of walnuts: 0.2
Number of servings: 3

Total ounces of mixed greens: 5.1
Total ounces of blueberries: 6.0
Total ounces of walnuts: 0.6
Note: You must ask the user for an ingredient, and then the amount of that ingredient (as shown in the example above) in order to pass the autograder.

Starter Code:
"""
This program asks the user for three ingredients,
three amounts, and a number of servings, and
determines how much of each ingredient is needed
to serve the specified number of servings.
