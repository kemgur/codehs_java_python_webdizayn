Assignment:
Tracy wants a colored bead bracelet!
Tracy liked the bracelet you made her for her birthday but now she wants you to make it with colored beads.

The beads of your bracelet should:

-Alternate between blue, red, and purple
-Be the same size and structure as your previous code

Hint:
-You can start by copy and pasting the code you wrote in our previous lesson. Then find a way to fill the beads with color.
-A for loop will help shorten your code!
-Remember to return to the center of the bracelet circle between drawing each bead!
