Assignment:
Have Tracy draw a stack of squares and circles from the bottom of the canvas to the top.
Keep in mind:

-Each shape should have a height and width of 50 pixels
-Shapes should be stacked in the center of the canvas
-The first shape in the bottom of the stack should be a square (see the image below)

Hints:
-To keep your code from getting cluttered, create 2 functions- one to draw a square and one to draw a circle! Don’t forget naming rules!
-You can move Tracy to the next position inside your functions
-Tracy draws circles starting at the bottom center of the circle when she’s facing right
-A for loop can help repeat your shape stack to the top of the canvas!

Starter Code:
No starter code.
