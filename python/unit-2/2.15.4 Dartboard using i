"""
Assignment:
Here you will complete the same task as in the dartboard exercise, using the value of i instead of an outside variable.
Make sure your dartboard:

Consists of 4 concentric circles
Has the center circle placed in the middle of the canvas with a radius of 25
Has three circles surrounding the middle, that each increase in radius by 25 pixels
Use the value of i to control the radius of the circles
Hint: Determine how to use extended for loop parameters to produce the exact radius values you need (25, 50, 75, 100).

Starter Code:
