"""
Assignment:
Write a program that will draw four tri-colored triangles next to one another in the center of the canvas.
Make sure your triangles:

-Have sides of different colors (red, green and blue!)
-Have sides that are 50 pixels long
-Are centered around the y-axis
-Have sides drawn with a thickness of 5 pixels

Hints:
-Tracy is drawing 4 triangles, which means that 2 should be left of center and 2 should be right of center. Each triangle has a width of 50. This should help you figure out where to place Tracy to center your triangles!
-Try to figure out how you can use a for loop to shorten your code!
