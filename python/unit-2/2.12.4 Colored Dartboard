"""
Assignment:
Write a program that draws a colored dartboard!
Alter the “Dartboard” program you wrote previously so that each circle is filled in with a color that a user has given

Remember that your dartboard:

-Consists of 4 concentric circles
-Has the center circle placed in the middle of the canvas with a radius of 25
-Has three circles surrounding the middle, that each increase in radius by 25 pixels

Hints:
-Circles stack on top of one another, so you will need to start with the largest circle rather than the smallest in order to see each circle drawn!
-Use a variable called color_choice to save the user input.
-A variable called radius shoud be used to control each circle’s size.

Starter Code:
No starter code.

Solution Code:

#inputs = ["black", "blue", "yellow", "red"]

# Set initial value of variable to 25

radius = 100

def draw_circle():
    color_choice = input("What color should this circle be?: ")
    pendown()
    color(color_choice)
    begin_fill()
    circle(radius)
    penup()
    end_fill()

    forward(25)
    right(90)
