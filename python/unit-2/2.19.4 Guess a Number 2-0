"""
Assignment:
Enhance your ‘Guess a Number’ program to tell the user if their guess was high or low.
Follow these guidelines:

-Ask user for a number 1 - 10.
-If they did not guess the secret number, the user will be shown:
  -an up arrow if the secret number is higher than their guess
  -a down arrow if the secret number is lower than their guess
-When they guess the secret number, a checkmark will appear and the user will stop being asked to guess.

Hint: Start with the ‘Guess a Number’ program you already wrote and add in an if-elif-else statement!

Starter Code:
No starter code.
