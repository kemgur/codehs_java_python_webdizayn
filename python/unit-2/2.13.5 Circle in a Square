"""
Assignment:
Write a program that asks a user for a radius value and then draws a blue circle inside a red square in the center of the canvas.
Make sure to use parameters so that the circle-square combo can be altered to any size.

Hint: You can only collect one value named radius from the user, so you may first need to determine a mathematical relationship between these two shapes.

Starter Code:
No starter code.
