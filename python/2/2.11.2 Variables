Question: 2
Which program will have Tracy move forward 10, then turn left and move forward 20?


+
distance = 10
forward(distance)
left(90)
distance = distance * 2
forward(distance)


distance = 10
forward(distance)
left(90)
forward(distance)


distance = 10
distance = distance * 2
forward(distance)
left(90)
forward(distance)


distance = 10
forward(distance)
left(90)
forward(distance)
distance = distance * 2

Question: 3

Four Squares Output



square_length = 20
for i in range(4):
    forward(square_length)
    left(90)
square_length = square_length * 2

+
square_length = 20
for i in range(4):
    for i in range(4):
        forward(square_length)
        left(90)
    square_length = square_length * 2


square_length = 20
for i in range(4):
    forward(square_length)
    left(90)
    square_length = square_length * 2


square_length = 20
for i in range(4):
    for i in range(4):
        forward(square_length)
        left(90)
        square_length = square_length * 2
