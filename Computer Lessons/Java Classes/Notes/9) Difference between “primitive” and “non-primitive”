
Difference between “primitive” and “non-primitive” data types:
1) Primitives contain just values, non-primitives contain values and methods inside the container.

2) Primitives start with lower case, non-primitives start with upper case.

3) Primitives are created by Java, we cannot create primitive data types. 
Non-primitives can be created by programmer, java created some as String.

4) The size of primitive types depend on the data type, non-primitives types have all the same size.
