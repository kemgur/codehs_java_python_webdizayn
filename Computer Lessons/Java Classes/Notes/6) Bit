Every computer has memory. Memories are separated into small squares like that. 
Every square is called bit. Soma data can be put inside this area. 
But some data is larger.You need to use two bits for example. It depends of the size your data. 
What can we put inside a bit?

I told you, JDK(Java Development Kit) compile our java codes and convert them to 0 and 1.
In every bit, you can put inside 0 or 1. 
What is the meaning of one, one is, there is electricity(elektrisiti) in that square. 
What is the meaning of zero, there is no electricity(elektrisiti) in that square. 
Every bit can contain 0 or 1


Note: 8 bits are called 1 byte.

 
Bit
A bit is the smallest unit of data in a computer. 
(Bit, bilgisayardaki en küçük veri birimidir.)

A bit has a single binary value, either 0 or 1.
(Bir bit, 0 veya 1 olmak üzere tek bir ikili değere sahiptir.)



Note: 8 bits are called 1 byte.

I hope data, bit and byte are clear for everyone.
