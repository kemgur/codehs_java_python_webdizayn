How to add comments among the codes ?

1) One line comment: If your comment is just a single line, using that one, it is a good option.

// After double forward slash type your comment

2) Multi-line comments: Sometimes we need to type multiple sentenses. Can you see line 1,2,3... 
No need to more forward slashes for every line. Instead of doing that one, you can do /*(forward slash, asterisk and asterisk, forward slash ) between that too notations, you can type one more comments line.

Between /* and */ type your multi line comments
/*
Comment line 1 
Comment line 2 
Comment line 3
*/
