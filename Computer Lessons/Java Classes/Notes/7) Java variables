Variable is the name of reserved area allocated(älıkeytîd-tahsis edilmis) in memory. 
(Değişken, bellekte ayrılan ayrılmış alanın adıdır.)

In other words, it is a name of memory location.
(Başka bir deyişle, hafıza konumunun bir adıdır.)

A variable is a container which holds the value while the java program is executed.
(Değişken, Java programı yürütülürken değeri tutan bir kapsayıcıdır.)


HOW TO CREATE A VARIABLE?
To create a variable, you will do two main things. 

1) => Data Type: You will type the data type. 
2) => Variable Name : You will put tne name, for your variable. 

I told you,  everything which you created needs name in java. 
If you are creating a variable, it needs name. You should tell  java, its data type.  

Variable Declaration :
DataType VariableName ;
int        age ;
char       initial ;

If I am creating a variable for age, its data type will be int.
  


Note: If you will declare more than one variable with the same data type;

DataType    VariableNames ;
int         age, height, distance ;



If you completed your sentence, you will put dat(.) over here. 
In java instead of dat(.) we used semi column(;) Same functionality.

DEGER ATAMA:

When you type that  code (int age;) it means, you created a container.
But can you see, I didn't tell java the value of age.
Java thinks like that , you didn't give the value for age , I will put over here 0, 
This is default value for integer. 
If you create integer variable, java put inside the container as default. 
Because of that over here, I drove image like that. 
Age is name of the variable. Orange part is the container, 0(zero) inside the orange part is default value. 0(zero) is coming from java.  

If I tell java age is 15, Java will change that one to 15. 
If you don't tell anything, Java will put over here 0(zero). 

////////////////

CHAR'A DEGER ATAMA:

Look at here. I typed that code => char initial; 
What does it mean?
Java went to memory, it created a container like that. It put something weird in the container.
What is that?
For every character, java has a code. When you type a(ey), java doesn't know a(ey).
Java works with numbers. Java accept(eksept)  a(ey) as 97,
When you type b(bi), java doesn't know b(bi), Java knows b(bi) ->98
For every character, java has specific values.
For example for !(exclamation mark) java has a value, value is 33, 
If it is char , Java will put default zeros in the container. 
Those numbers are called ascii number. 
Ascii code is international number. When you go to Japan country,  
If you ask the java developer, What is ascii code of a(ey), He will tell you 97.
It is international value. It doesn't change. 

Do if you create a variable without assigning any number, it is called VARIABLE DECLARATION.  
I declared a variable, but I didn't assign any number for the variables.   
   
 In coding area, typing codes short, it is better.

Note: For every data type, Java prints something deferent. 
      For integer and char, java prints 0(zero).  

If data type is deferent, there is no short way.  
Short way is valid, if the data type is same.

HOW TO ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE.

Data Type VariableName = Value;
If yo wanna make age type =(equal) 27;
int age = 27;
What will java do? Java will get the value over here(27)
And then java puts the value in the container.


char initial = 'A';
 1      2    3  4 5 Steps(How many steps are there?)
For initial put(=)equal sign and put the character.
Why did I put over there single quot?
Because for chars value must be between single quot.
Otherwise java not understand it is char or not. 
When you type that code('A') in memory, you will have a  container like that,
Inside the container have 'A',


///////////////////
Deferent Way:
For assignment there are different ways.
int age; => Over here, I created age variable in the first line.  
age = 27 ; => I am making assignment second line, it works. 
If you see something like that, no need to surprise.  


int age, height, distance ; 
age = 27 ;
height = 185 ;
distance = 470 ; 

//////////////////////
Note: Declaration(aciklama) and assignment can be done in different ways like;

1)
int age; 
age = 27 ;

2) 
int age, height, distance ; 
age = 27 ;
height = 185 ;
distance = 470 ;

3) This way is best way.It is our dream code.It is sorter than other. 
int age=27, height=185, distance=470 ;
