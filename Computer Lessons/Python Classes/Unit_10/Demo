Demo:
-Our final project starts today. It will continue for 5 days.
-In this lesson, we will try to understand the logic of the project.
We can extend it if we need more time.

-We will do a project demo for this lesson.
-The name of the project is Guess the Word.
-When I click the Run button, there are 3 lines at the bottom.
-I see how many letters the word consists of on the 1st line.
-I see how many guesses to make on line 2.
-There's a Guess section on the 3rd line. Here I write the letter I guessed.
-When I type multiple letters in the Guess section, I get this message.
-I get this message when I enter a special character in the Guess section.
-I get this message when I enter the correct letter in the Guess section.
-In addition, the correct letter replaces the dash.
-In addition, my right to guess has not decreased.

-I got this message when I entered the wrong letter.
-In addition, my right to guess has decreased by 1 point.

-I got this message when I knew the word.
-Let's play this game by trying different options in this lesson.
-Let's try to understand the code logic in the game.
We can start writing the codes tomorrow.
