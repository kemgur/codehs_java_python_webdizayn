For loop is a programing construct that allows you to execute code a predetermined number of times. 
(For döngüsü, kodu önceden belirlenmiş sayıda çalıştırmanıza izin veren bir programlama yapısıdır.)

construct(kınstrakt):yapi, insa etmek, 
predetermined(priditırmînd):önceden belirlenmiş, 

5:
The for loop
Here is a simple example of a for loop. 

Let's look at a program that has a simple example of a for loop in it. 
(İçinde basit bir for döngüsü örneği olan bir programa bakalım.)


For loop printed "Hello" 4 times. 
Because it says 4 in the for loop parenthesis.

11:
 End of the for loop line we have to apply indented by one level.

12:
i is actually a variable.
More specifically it's an int variable.
 It starts  at 0(zero).

14:
The range function
I goes from 0 up to but not including the number in range parenthesis.

15:
In this example, the variable i will start at the (1)one and it will gradually be incremented up to to but not including six.
gradually(gräculi):yavaşlar yavaşlar, derece derece, aşamalı olarak, 

16:
In this example i still starts at one and goes up two but not including six.  
Go up: yükselmek
