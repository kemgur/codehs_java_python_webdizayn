Hi in this lesson we will be learning about HTML colors.

We will watch this video together.
This subject is very important. 
You should not miss any detail.

1:
In this example we used style attribute. We set the style have color: blue.

When you run the code, the color of text has changed to blue. 
When you run the code, the color of text has changed to red.

5:
cyan(sayan):
blanchedalmind(blençdelmind)

6:
Aren't there Way more than 140 colors?
140'tan fazla renk yok mu?

7:
Html color codes.

Color in html can either be:
(Html'deki renk şunlardan biri olabilir:)

Are there only 140 colors or could there be more?

* A valid color name: red, green, cyan,

In the previous presentation, we saw that there are 140 different colors on the w3school website.
By the way, what is your favorite color?

* An RGB value.(rgb(0,255,0))

* A Hexadecimal(heksi-desimil) (aka "hex") color code.
  #FF00FF

9:
RGB Color Encoding(kodlama)
The RGB Color Encoding system allows us to create colors by specifying the amount of red, green and blue in the color.
(RGB Renk Kodlama sistemi, renkteki kırmızı, yeşil ve mavi miktarını belirterek renkler oluşturmamızı sağlar.)

10:
Any color can be created by combining Red Green and Blue light at varying intensities.
 -at varying(vering) intensities(intensitis)
 -combining(kımbaynîng):birleştiren


11:
What do you see in this picture?
When red and green are mixed, yellow color occurs.

12:
Every single picture has red, green and blue color. 

What color can this rgb value be?


14:
A color has 3 values
This is ARB system. 

17:
Each "color channel" gets a value in the range 0 - 255

18:
0 -255
That's 256^3 = 3 over 256 = almost 17 milyon different colors.


23:
Hexadecimal(hekzıdesimil) Color Codes:()Onaltılık Renk Kodları:
What is the hexadecimal color system?


24:
The decimal numbering system has 10 digits.(0-1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9)

25:
It is starting 0 base 10.
We can write all numbers as two-digit numbers base 10.


43:
Hexadecimal numbering system has 16 digits.
0-16(0base 16), 1-16(1 base 16)

70:
00 base 16 = 0 base 10
FF base 16 = 255 base 10

It is very difficult for us to keep all of them in mind.
(Hepsini akilda tutmamiz cok zordur.)

 
=>
There are many options in rgb and hexadecimal.
