Hi in this lesson we will be learning about HTML styling.

4:
Style attribute lets us add several different types of styles to our HTML elements.
(Style niteliği, HTML öğelerimize birkaç farklı stil türü eklememize izin verir.)

5:
Ho do we use this well.
We have to do is insert into the opening tag the style attribute.
(Yapmamız gereken açılış etiketine style niteliğini eklemek.)

The sintex should be like that. 
<tagname  style="property:value;">

6:
We see that we define the property that we're styling colon then the value and then a semicolon.

7:
We can have multiple styles on one tag all we have to do is separate out these property value pairs with semicolons.

As long as all in double quotes we can have style equals and then a massive string defining several 
Different values.

10:
So using this strategy we can add several styles to a single tag.  

text-align changes the position of the word.
