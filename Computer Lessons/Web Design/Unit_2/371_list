Hi in this video we will be learning about HTML lists.
We see lists a lot on webpages.
In fact here's a list of reasons.
(Aslında burada bir nedenler listesi var.)
2:
HTML lists allow us to group a set of related items in lists.
List of reasons to use lists.
	* Organize information
	* Simple structure
	* Easy to read and write

	1.Arrange things in order.
	(1. İşleri sırayla düzenleyin.)
     	   a) Most important
	   b) Less impontantint
	   c) Least important	

3) All time we see them all over internet. 
(Onları her zaman internet üzerinden görüyoruz.)
Let's go to the wikipedia
As you see lists of list of list.
This website holds most of list articles 


4:
So There are two types of lists in HTML,
When you use the Unordered list, you may see different marks at the beginning of the line.

An unordered list starts with the <ul> tag. Each list item starts with the <li> tag.


When you use the ordered list, you may see number  or letter  at the beginning of the line.


5:
The <ul> Tag
The <ul> tag defines an unordered list. 

6:
There is one more tag we're going to need and 
That is <li> tag that stands for list item. 
The <li> tag defines a list item inside a list. 

So using the <ul> tag and <li> tag we can make unordered list. 

8:
So inside the <ul> tag we're gonna have an <li> tag
For each item in the list. 

9:
The result looks like this we have an unordered list apple babana milk bread.
Each of them have a bullet(bûlıt) point.  


10: 
What about order lists. 
The <ol> tag stand for ordered list. 
The <ol> tag defines an ordered list. 
So just like with the <ul> tag we have an opening and closing <ol> tag.

12:
So inside the <ol> tag we're gonna have an <li> tag
For each item in the list. 

13:
<li> is used regardless of what type of list we're making.
(<li> ne tür bir liste oluşturduğumuzdan bağımsız olarak kullanılır.)

=>regardless of(rıgärdlıs ıv): hiç önem vermeyerek , umursamayarak , -e bakmayarak 2-her şeye rağmen , ne olursa olsun, e bakılmaksızın, gözetilmeksizin

14:
The result here we have 1 2 3 4 instead of bullet.
=> bullet(boolıt):

16:
Nesting List
For example there is list. I can put a list inside of list. 

20:
Inside this example there are more detail. 
 
inside the cookies we can add nested list. 

But we should use <ul> tag as a first step.
second we can add a list inside the cookies by using <li> tag.
