 I think some students were afraid of the quiz. However, the quiz was very simple.

Hello guys. I'm going to start the quiz soon, first I want to say the rules.

1) It is forbidden to talk to and copy from your friend after the exam has started.
2) It is forbidden to enter sites other than CodeHs during the quiz.
3) When I realize this, your exam is over and you get 45.
4) During the quiz, you can check the previous topics and the docks section from the Codes site.

When everyone has finished their quiz, we will start the new lesson.
Tomorrow, you have one more chance to solve the Quiz again.
